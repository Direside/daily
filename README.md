# Daily

This is my daily standup repo. Updates are pushed to the `standup.md` file and then committed to the repo. Webhooks then send the information to a collector that is able to parse the information and extract what I've been working on, as well as provide it to others via a UI.

This is intended to be a data stream for Project Helix.
